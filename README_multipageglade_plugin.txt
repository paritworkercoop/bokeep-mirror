An experimental new plugin that allows you to define a multi-page
glade interfaces through a configuration file. The common case of having
labels and the final financial transaction based on the sum of gtk.Entry
values is supported through the configuration language as well, so
a fairly complicated, multi-field, multi-page series of forms can be put
together.

Not yet made available for auto-detection, install with the string
bokeep.plugins.multipageglade

Don't edit a multipage glade config file while you do edits to a
transaction using that configuration on screen
