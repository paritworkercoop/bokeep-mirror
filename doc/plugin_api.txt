Every plugin should have a get_plugin_class function. If your plugin is a single python module, declare get_plugin_class in that file. If your plugin is a python package, declare or import get_plugin_class from your __init__.py.

This function should return a class that represents your plugin. When a user adds your plugin, BoKeep will instantiate the class returned by get_plugin_class . 

Your plugin should implement the methods documented in bokeep.

>>> import bokeep.prototype_plugin
>>> help(bokeep.prototype_plugin)

You can inherit from bokeep.prototype_plugin.PrototypePlugin if you want a dummy plugin to start with, but you will more or less have to override all of its methods.
