Please note that versions of GnuCash currently available at http://gnucash.org are licensed under GNU General Public License version 2 and at your option version 3 (only) for some files and version 2 or at your option any later version for other files. To be able to legally redistribute a copy of GnuCash and BoKeep together you need to update GnuCash files to version 3. All other BoKeep dependencies are GPL v3 compatible.

ParIT will be preparing a patch to GnuCash shortly to provide convenient access under GPL v3.

ParIT's members are committed free software activists who would be hacking on free software even if we didn't have jobs doing so. Our articles of incorporation forbid our company from doing proprietary work, so you can trust that we won't be releasing proprietary versions and can feel comfortable assigning copyright on contributions to us should you wish to.

You may also opt to assign copyright on contributions to help us be better positioned to enforce the license and to ensure your code is included under any enforcement action.

That being said, we do not require copyright assignments on contributions. All contributions must be licensed under terms compatible with GPL v3. All contributions to the BoKeep core or to plugins that we deem strategically important to our business must be made under GPLv3 or at your option any later version or under a non-copyleft license unlikely to conflict with future versions of the GNU GPL.

Should our engagement with the community be successful and we consider the effort worth our time, we will consider assigning our copyright on Bo-Keep to a foundation / non-profit such as the Free Software Foundation or Software Freedom Conservancy.
